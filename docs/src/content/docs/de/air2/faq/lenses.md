### How do I change the flat lenses in the INMO Air?

The sunglasses version is INMO Air's default configuration. The front lens of INMO Air has a replacement button, so you can gently remove it and replace it with the lens you require.



### How do I install near-vision lenses in my INMO Air?

It is recommended that you use lenses with a refractive index of 1.67 or higher (regardless of brand), and you can have a professional fitting at a professional optical store.



### How do I make the lens brackets fit properly?

INMO Air has an adjustable joist that allows you to customise it based on your joist height, shape, and personal preferences.

You can modify it to fit your height, shape, and preferences.

Charging



### How should I charge my INMO Air2?

INMO Air charges and transmits data via a Type-C connector. The Type-C connector is located at the end of the right temple of the INMO Air, and we recommend an adapter that meets the requirements below to charge the INMO Air2.

1. Users must use a suitable charger 5V 1A

2. Users must use a standard charger with appropriate overcharge protection circuitry (do not use cheap chargers)
