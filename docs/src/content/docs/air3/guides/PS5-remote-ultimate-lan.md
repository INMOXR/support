* **It’s called MirrorPlay on Apple devices and PSPlay on Android devices—they have the same functionality. Android version supports Chinese, while the Apple version does not.**

## Taking Apple devices as an example

* Search for "MirrorPlay" in the App Store and download it.

* The app will automatically redirect to the official website's login page (this step is identical to the official app) – enter your account credentials to complete the binding process.

* If the binding is successful, a "successful" prompt will appear.
  Select "No" – do not set up external network access for now (LAN-only mode remains active).

## Possible Issues

Due to the fact that PSN servers are located outside your region, you may encounter a situation where your PS5 is not detected after logging into your account. If this happens, please make a note of your **PSN-Account-ID** (the string of numbers displayed below your account name).

1. Return to the registration interface - Open Advanced settings - ☑ Register manually

2. Enter the pairing code currently displayed on the PS console in the "Registration number" field.

3. Enter the string of numbers you noted down earlier (note: this is not your account name) in the "PSN Account ID" field.

* Tap"Allow"

The binding of the host and software has been completed.


*🔺If the binding still fails after manually entering the ID, the only remaining method is to use a proxy to enable the global mode (e.g., for logging into PSN).*

## Software Recommendation Settings
