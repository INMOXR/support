#### Step 1: Console Side-Required Settings for Xbox

1. Turn on your console and log in with your account. Ensure the region of your device is a location that supports streaming services, such as the United States or Europe—Chinese mainland editions are not supported.

2. In the console's **Settings > Equipment& connections**, select **Remote function**.

3. Select "Enable Remote Function" and you can also check "Enable PlayTo Streaming" while you're at it.

4. If you want to be able to wake up your Xbox anytime and anywhere from the streaming device to start gaming while it’s in standby mode—instead of having to turn on the Xbox manually—you can configure this in the **Power Options** on this page: select the **Sleep** mode.

- **Completion of Console Setup**: No need to re-adjust console settings for subsequent streaming via either the official App or XBXPlay

#### Step 2: Download the XBXPlay client.

1. After installing XBXPlay, launch the application and first tap the menu in the top-left corner.

2. There is a toggle in the top-right corner here. During streaming, this toggle allows your streaming device to function as a virtual controller to operate the console, instead of displaying the streaming screen.

3. Generally speaking, this virtual watch is rarely used.

Next, select "Register a new Xbox".

4. After completing the full Microsoft account login process, you can start streaming. Consistent with the Xbox official App, the interface only retains one connection button—there’s no need to manually distinguish between local streaming and remote streaming, as the system will automatically adapt to the connection method.

#### Remote Streaming: Port Mapping List

* Below is the port list for Xbox Remote Streaming:

* Xbxplay requires port 9002 to be opened (TCP + UDP).

* Refer to Xbxplay's official documentation here: [https://grill2010.github.io/xbxplay/inde]
