### Why are my glasses unable to search after I activate my cell phone's hotspot?

Step 1: Determine whether you are using an Apple phone or an Android phone.



Step 2: If you have an Apple phone, you must enable \[Maximum Compatibility] in \[My Hotspot] before the glasses can search for the corresponding hotspot. It is also recommended that you turn off the WIFI switch and restart the search once after turning it on.

*Tips: There is no \[Maximum Compatibility] option in \[My Hotspot] if you use an old cell phone with an iPhone 11 or lower.*

*Tips: Some users with older iPhone 11 models do not have the \[Maximum Compatibility] option in \[My Hotspot], so their hotspots can be searched but not connected, indicating a compatibility issue.*



Step 3: For Android phones, confirm that the \[AP Band] is 2.4 GHz; if it is 5 GHz, the device will not be supported.



Step 4: For some of the most recent routers, the default password security protocol for WIFI hotspots is WAP3 or WAP2/3 hybrid, which is incompatible with our products, resulting in glasses cannot search for the corresponding hotspot. We will address this issue in a future version update.
