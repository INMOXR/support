### Why can't I cast the screen on my phone / phone can't find my glasslessï¼Ÿ

Step 1: As a priority, determine whether the glasses and cell phone are in the same local grid.



Step 2: Click the glasses to activate the screencasting service.



Step 3: In some cases, due to the low version of video software, individual users can search for their devices after updating their software (e.g. YouTube).



Step 4: This will result in a slow screen casting rate and delayed transmission in a network environment. The screen casting function is being restored by switching to a better network.



*Tips: Although some users activate the hotspot function, they fail to activate the data service, forming a "fake hotspot."*
