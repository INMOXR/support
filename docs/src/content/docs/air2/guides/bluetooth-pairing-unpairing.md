### How do I enable Bluetooth tethering?

Bluetooth - turn on Bluetooth - connect via cell phone inmolens.

Settings - Bluetooth - enable Bluetooth - locate a cell phone device to bind to - connect via inmolens



### How do I configure Bluetooth bindings?

1. Unbinding Inmolens APP in \[My Glasses].

2. Settings - Bluetooth - open Bluetooth - click on the bound device, and unbind it.



### Why am I unable to bind other phones? Or am I unable to bind my s again?

Step 1: As a priority, update the glasses and the app.



Step 2: Determine whether the user's cell phone has been removed from the glasses.



Step 3: If both have been unbundled, try syncing the glasses terminal with the cell phone to be bundled and turning Bluetooth off/on once to reconnect Bluetooth.



*Tips1: It is easier to connect and match the new device after unbinding the APP and the glasses; if only the APP side is unbinding, the glasses side is still unbinding.*

*Tips2: It is easier to unbind the device after the APP is unbundled from the glass; if you use your phone after the APP is unbundled, the glasses will retain the binding status of the corresponding device, and connection problems may occur.*



### What happens if the user connects to the glasses via Bluetooth on their phone rather than through the APP?

If you connect the glasses to your phone, you can use them as Bluetooth ears to listen to songs in the system's ears mode (version 1.8 or later).
