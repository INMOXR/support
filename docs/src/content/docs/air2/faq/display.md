### Why does my screen appear hazy or incomplete?

Step 1: Prioritize screen wiping and fingerprint removal. If there are residuals on display, the display will become blurry. We recommend wiping the lens with alcohol and pure water and focusing on the screen's light-emitting areas.



Step 2: If the screen is incomplete, it could be due to the individual's pupillary distance or the influence of eye boxes. It is recommended that you lend the glasses to friends or colleagues to see if there are any subjective differences between your own eyes.



When going outside, bright light may cause the display to be distorted, so it is best to wear sunglasses with the brightness set to maximum.
